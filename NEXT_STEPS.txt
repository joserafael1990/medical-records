# 🚀 Final Steps for Deployment

Great news! I have successfully:
1.  Connected to your Digital Ocean server (`134.199.196.165`).
2.  Installed **Docker** and **Doppler** on the server.
3.  Uploaded your project code and the production configuration.

Now, you just need to authorize Doppler and start the app.

## Step 1: Connect to your Server

Copy and paste this command into your terminal:

```bash
ssh root@134.199.196.165
```

**Password:** `k5Oso5fl3k8wXx6qEn4QFa368h%$GN`

## Step 2: Login to Doppler

Once you are inside the server, run:

```bash
cd app
doppler login
```

It will ask you to open a URL in your browser and enter an auth code. Do that.

## Step 3: Configure Doppler

After logging in, run:

```bash
doppler setup
```

-   **Project**: Select `cortex` (or your project name).
-   **Config**: Select `prd` (or `production`).

## Step 4: Start the Application

Finally, launch your application:

```bash
doppler run -- docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml up -d --build
```

## Verification

You can check if it's running with:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml ps
```

Your app should be live at: http://134.199.196.165:3000
